# Add Mattermost Channel

Adds Mattermost DMs, channels, threads, files, reactions, and interactive
approval cards. Messages arrive over Mattermost's WebSocket; card clicks return
to NanoClaw over an authenticated HTTP callback. Every step is safe to re-run.

## Discover the server first

Do this before installing the adapter or asking for a URL. The goal is to
reuse a healthy Mattermost the user already has and establish one canonical
base URL.

1. Check an existing `MATTERMOST_BASE_URL` in the current environment and
   NanoClaw env/config files. Do not print tokens or dump whole env files.
2. Probe likely local URLs, at least `http://localhost:8065` and
   `http://127.0.0.1:8065`, using `GET /api/v4/system/ping`. A listening port
   alone is not evidence that the service is Mattermost.
3. Inspect Docker/Compose for Mattermost containers. If a matching container
   exists but is stopped, offer to start it with its original mechanism; do not
   start or recreate it without the user's approval.
4. If you find a healthy server, show its URL and ask the user to use it or
   enter a different URL. Do not select a server automatically. Treat the
   localhost and 127.0.0.1 endpoints for the same container as one server.
5. If nothing healthy is found, offer Mattermost's maintained evaluation and
   deployment guidance from [SERVER_SETUP.md](SERVER_SETUP.md), then ask for
   the server URL after the operator has one running.

Set `MATTERMOST_BASE_URL` to the chosen canonical URL (scheme included, no
trailing slash), then use that exact hostname in browser/Desktop setup.
NanoClaw connects to Mattermost; it does not install or manage the server.

## Apply

### 1. Detect or select the server

Test the configured URL and the standard local URLs. A detected server is only
a suggestion. The user must select it.

```nc:run capture:discovery=.discovery,detected_url=.base_url,detected_config_access=.config_access,detected_container=.mattermost_container effect:fetch
node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/discover-server.mjs
```

```nc:operator when:discovery=found
NanoClaw found a healthy Mattermost server at {{detected_url}}. You can use this server or enter a different Mattermost URL.
```

```nc:prompt server_choice when:discovery=found normalize:lower validate:^(use|enter)$
Enter `use` to use {{detected_url}}. Enter `enter` to specify a different Mattermost URL.
```

```nc:run capture:base_url=.base_url,config_access=.config_access,mattermost_container=.mattermost_container effect:fetch when:server_choice=use
node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/select-server.mjs use "{{detected_url}}" "{{detected_config_access}}" "{{detected_container}}"
```

```nc:prompt entered_url when:server_choice=enter normalize:rstrip-slash validate:^https?://(?:[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9.-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?|\[[0-9A-Fa-f:.]+\])(?::[0-9]{1,5})?(?:/[A-Za-z0-9._~%+-]+)*$
Enter the Mattermost base URL. Include the scheme, for example `https://mattermost.example.com`.
```

```nc:run capture:base_url=.base_url,config_access=.config_access,mattermost_container=.mattermost_container effect:fetch when:server_choice=enter
node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/select-server.mjs enter "{{entered_url}}"
```

```nc:operator when:discovery=none
NanoClaw did not find a healthy Mattermost server. NanoClaw connects to a server but does not install or operate one. For a temporary local trial, follow Mattermost's official Quick Start Evaluation: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment-guide/quick-start-evaluation. For a persistent or production installation, choose a supported path in Mattermost's deployment guide: https://docs.mattermost.com/deployment-guide/server/deploy-server. Return here when the server is running.
```

```nc:prompt entered_url_new when:discovery=none normalize:rstrip-slash validate:^https?://(?:[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9.-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?|\[[0-9A-Fa-f:.]+\])(?::[0-9]{1,5})?(?:/[A-Za-z0-9._~%+-]+)*$
Mattermost base URL. Include the scheme, for example `https://mattermost.example.com`.
```

```nc:run capture:base_url=.base_url,config_access=.config_access,mattermost_container=.mattermost_container effect:fetch when:discovery=none
node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/select-server.mjs enter "{{entered_url_new}}"
```

### 2. Set the server SiteURL

Mattermost Desktop sends its configured server URL as the WebSocket Origin.
Before you install the adapter, set `ServiceSettings.SiteURL` to the same URL:
`{{base_url}}`. Keep
`ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL` blank. Do not change
`ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom` to correct an Origin error.

When discovery found host-local `mmctl`, ask before changing the server:

```nc:prompt site_url_action normalize:lower validate:^(set|already)$ when:config_access=host
Enter `set` to set SiteURL to {{base_url}} and clear WebsocketURL. Enter `already` if these values are already correct.
```

```nc:run effect:external when:site_url_action=set
mmctl config set ServiceSettings.SiteURL "{{base_url}}" --local
mmctl config set ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL "" --local
```

When discovery found `mmctl` inside a local Mattermost container, ask before
changing it there:

```nc:prompt site_url_action_docker normalize:lower validate:^(set|already)$ when:config_access=docker
Enter `set` to set SiteURL to {{base_url}} in {{mattermost_container}} and clear WebsocketURL. Enter `already` if these values are already correct.
```

```nc:run effect:external when:site_url_action_docker=set
docker exec "{{mattermost_container}}" mmctl config set ServiceSettings.SiteURL "{{base_url}}" --local
docker exec "{{mattermost_container}}" mmctl config set ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL "" --local
```

If local configuration access is unavailable, tell the operator:

```nc:operator when:config_access=unavailable
Set Mattermost ServiceSettings.SiteURL to {{base_url}}. Leave ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL blank. As a System Admin, run `mmctl config set ServiceSettings.SiteURL "{{base_url}}"`. Run `mmctl config set ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL ""`. You can also use System Console → Environment → Web Server. Do not change ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom to correct an Origin error.
```

```nc:prompt site_url_ready normalize:lower validate:^ready$ when:config_access=unavailable
Enter `ready` after you save these Mattermost settings.
```

Use the public client configuration endpoint to verify the settings. The
command must print `{{base_url}}` and then a blank line.

```nc:run effect:fetch
curl -fsS "{{base_url}}/api/v4/config/client?format=old" | node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/read-response.mjs config "{{base_url}}"
```

### 3. Copy and register the channel

Copy the canonical adapter and registration test from the `channels` branch.
The payload must include authenticated transport liveness and setup callback
probes. Existing files are preserved by installation; on an older installation,
run `/update-skills` to refresh Mattermost before rerunning this skill.

```nc:copy from-branch:channels
src/channels/mattermost.ts
src/channels/mattermost-registration.test.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/adapter.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/adapter.test.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/format.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/index.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/rest.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/thread-id.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/types.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/websocket.ts
src/channels/mattermost-adapter/websocket.test.ts
```

Append the channel's single reach-in to the barrel, skipping it if present.

```nc:append to:src/channels/index.ts
import './mattermost.js';
```

Remove the unscoped `chat-adapter-mattermost` package when it is installed.
Nothing in this repository imports it: it is typosquat-shaped against the
scoped `@chat-adapter` family, so any copy in `package.json` is stale or
mistaken and would sit beside the audited implementation copied from the
`channels` branch.

```nc:run
if node -e "const p=require('./package.json'); process.exit(p.dependencies?.['chat-adapter-mattermost'] ? 0 : 1)"; then pnpm remove chat-adapter-mattermost; fi
```

Install the vendored adapter's direct WebSocket dependencies at the exact
supported versions.

```nc:dep
ws@8.21.3
@types/ws@8.18.1
```

### 4. Create and authenticate the bot

Tell the operator:

```nc:operator
Now create a Mattermost bot for NanoClaw:
1. As a System Admin, open System Console → Integrations → Bot Accounts. Turn on Enable Bot Account Creation. This setting permits bot creation. You do not create the bot on this page.
2. Return to the Mattermost workspace. Open Product menu → Integrations → Bot Accounts. Select Add Bot Account. Create a bot, for example `nanoclaw`.
3. Copy the access token.
4. Add the bot to each required team and channel. Mattermost does not add bots to teams or channels automatically.
5. Keep the token secret. If you lose the token, create a replacement. Deactivate the old token after the replacement works.
```

```nc:prompt bot_token secret reuse:MATTERMOST_BOT_TOKEN normalize:trim validate:^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{20,}$
Mattermost bot access token (20 or more letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens).
```

The configuration helper below authenticates this token and captures the bot
identity before it saves any settings.

### 5. Configure authenticated card callbacks

Approvals require Mattermost itself—not the browser—to reach NanoClaw. Ask for
a URL routable from the Mattermost server. It may be NanoClaw's base URL or the
full `/webhook/mattermost` route; the adapter normalizes either form.

```nc:prompt callback_url reuse:MATTERMOST_CALLBACK_URL normalize:rstrip-slash validate:^https?://(?:[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9.-]*[A-Za-z0-9])?|\[[0-9A-Fa-f:.]+\])(?::[0-9]{1,5})?(?:/[A-Za-z0-9._~%+-]+)*$
Callback URL reachable from Mattermost, such as `https://nanoclaw.example.com` or `http://host.docker.internal:3000/webhook/mattermost`.
```

Save the selected server, authenticated bot token, and callback URL. On a rerun,
offer to reuse each existing setting; save replacements when the operator
chooses them. Mattermost does not sign action callbacks, so the helper creates
a random shared secret locally on first setup. It preserves that secret on
reruns so existing approval cards keep working. Never print the secret.

```nc:run capture:bot_user_id=.id,bot_username=.username effect:external remove:.claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/remove-config.mjs
pnpm exec tsx .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/configure.ts "{{base_url}}" "{{bot_token}}" "{{callback_url}}"
```

Tell the operator:

```nc:operator
Make sure that the Mattermost server can reach the callback host. For a private host or Docker bridge name, add the host name or IP address in System Console → Environment → Developer → Allow untrusted internal connections. Use a publicly trusted HTTPS certificate in production.
```

### 6. Resolve the owner's DM

Ask for the Mattermost username that will own this NanoClaw installation.

```nc:prompt owner_username normalize:lower validate:^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]{0,63}$
Your Mattermost username, without `@`.
```

Resolve that user and open the DM shared with the bot.

```nc:run capture:owner_user_id=.id,owner_handle=.id effect:fetch
curl -sf "{{base_url}}/api/v4/users/username/{{owner_username}}" -H "Authorization: Bearer {{bot_token}}"
```

```nc:run capture:platform_id effect:fetch validate:^mattermost:[a-z0-9]{26}$
curl -sf -X POST "{{base_url}}/api/v4/channels/direct" -H "Authorization: Bearer {{bot_token}}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '["{{owner_user_id}}","{{bot_user_id}}"]' | node .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/read-response.mjs dm
```

The resolved `platform_id`, `owner_handle`, and `owner_username` are used by
`/init-first-agent`. If an owner exists, use `/manage-channels` instead.

### 7. Build, test, and restart

Build the composed host to guard the typed Chat SDK bridge call and dependency.

```nc:run effect:build
pnpm run build
```

Run the registration test through the channel barrel. Also run the installed
adapter regression tests.

```nc:run effect:test
pnpm exec vitest run src/channels/mattermost-registration.test.ts src/channels/mattermost-adapter/adapter.test.ts src/channels/mattermost-adapter/websocket.test.ts
```

Restart NanoClaw so the channel and credentials load.

```nc:run effect:restart
bash setup/lib/restart.sh --channel mattermost
```

Verify the new host loaded the selected bot and settings, and that the selected
bot and owner belong to the DM. The helper checks the host's actual listener,
then creates a temporary diagnostic card in that DM and invokes its action
through Mattermost. It requires receipt by this host and deletes the diagnostic
card afterward. This exercises Mattermost's outbound routing and TLS policy.
It reads the saved settings without printing credentials.

```nc:run effect:wire
pnpm exec tsx .claude/skills/add-mattermost/scripts/verify-runtime.ts "{{bot_user_id}}" "{{owner_user_id}}" "{{platform_id}}"
```

## Next steps

For a first channel, continue with `/init-first-agent` using `mattermost`,
`{{platform_id}}`, and `{{owner_username}}`. Otherwise run `/manage-channels`.

Send the bot a DM and mention it in a joined channel. The first mention in an
unwired channel sends an approval card to the owner's bot DM. Approve it there;
NanoClaw replays the held message after creating the wiring.

Click a real approval card to verify the approval workflow beyond the automated
callback transport check. Success replaces the buttons with the chosen result.
An unsigned probe must return `401` (alone this does not identify the host):

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}' \
  http://<nanoclaw-host>:3000/webhook/mattermost
```

## Channel information

- **type:** `mattermost`
- **platform ID:** `mattermost:<channel-id>` for channels and DMs
- **threads:** channel posts use optional Mattermost reply roots
- **group trigger:** mention-sticky, scoped per thread
- **DM trigger:** every message
- **unknown channels:** request owner approval
- **transport:** WebSocket inbound, REST outbound, HTTP action callbacks

## Troubleshooting

**The token check returns 401.** The token is stale, belongs to a deactivated
bot, or was pasted incorrectly. Create a replacement token and deactivate the
old token after the replacement works.

**The bot ignores a channel.** Add it to that team and channel. Membership
changes are observed, but restarting NanoClaw forces a fresh subscription.

**A new channel gets no immediate reply.** Check the owner's DM with the bot.
NanoClaw holds the first message behind a channel-approval card and deduplicates
later mentions until that card is resolved.

**Desktop messages appear only after a manual refresh.** The server can reject
the WebSocket Origin. Use the same host name in the Desktop server URL,
`MATTERMOST_BASE_URL`, and `ServiceSettings.SiteURL`. Keep
`ServiceSettings.WebsocketURL` blank. Verify the values through
`/api/v4/config/client?format=old`. Check the server logs for `request origin
not allowed`. Do not change `ServiceSettings.AllowCorsFrom` to correct this
error. For a container installation, set SiteURL in the server configuration.

**Cards render but clicks do nothing.** Rerun the runtime helper above. It binds
the listener and callback receipt to this host; a `401` alone cannot do that.
Mattermost logs report blocked hosts and TLS errors. If a verification request
times out after creating a card, remove that diagnostic card from the owner DM.

**Runtime verification requests a payload refresh.** Run `/update-skills` for
Mattermost, rebuild, and rerun this skill. The normal install path preserves
existing adapter files; old payloads cannot prove the running configuration.

**The adapter repeatedly reconnects.** Confirm `/api/v4/websocket` supports
WebSocket upgrades through every reverse proxy and that idle connections live
longer than the adapter heartbeat.

**Messages arrive but no agent runs.** Inspect `ncl dropped-messages list` and
`ncl wirings list`. `no_agent_wired` means approval is pending or no wiring was
created; it is not an adapter failure.
