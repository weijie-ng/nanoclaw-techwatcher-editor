# OpenCode provider execution and setup

The provider targets NanoClaw's host contract seam version 1 and pins the native
OpenCode CLI and SDK together at 1.18.25. The skill owns its runtime, host, setup,
and authentication adapters. The core supplies provider contracts, delivery
wording, the memory renderer, resolved MCP configuration, and container policy.

## Turn completion

OpenCode events describe activity and can include stale idle events or recoverable
errors during compaction. HTTP disconnects can also leave native execution alive.
Using event order as completion authority caused missed replies and unsafe replay.

Each shared runtime therefore serializes prompts and continuously reads its event
stream before starting a turn. The synchronous native prompt response determines
completion. A client-assigned user message ID and durable session history identify
the turn's assistant messages, including native compaction continuation. All
deliverable text parts are retained; internal summaries are excluded. Missing
history or uncertain execution fails visibly without submitting the prompt again.
An abort must settle the original native prompt within a bounded cleanup window;
otherwise the provider stops its owned server before permitting another turn.

Completed native errors retain earlier verified text and return one failed
result, so the core completes the exchange once. Native OpenCode owns retry
counts; each history page has its own bounded request.
Raw API diagnostics stay in the error event for logs and never enter result
text, where response-body markup could be mistaken for a deliverable. The core
sends a fixed failure notice, including after a partial reply.

This uses the existing SDK and persistence. A new retry queue, parallel native
prompts, and idle-event completion would add ambiguous execution ownership.

## Memory and native continuation

Before each external turn, the runner renders memory through the registered
shared hook and atomically writes it with current core instructions and delivery
wording to one file under writable XDG data. The write happens under the existing
turn lock. The file is listed in native `instructions` next to the group's
`CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE.local.md`.

OpenCode 1.18.25 rereads those files on each model step, including native
continuation after compaction. Task children use the same global configuration
and inherit the current turn's file. No plugin, native memory hooks, parent walk,
or per-session snapshot store is needed.

Memory rendering runs once per external turn, including a resumed session.
A compaction in the middle of a turn uses that turn's starting memory snapshot;
the next external turn refreshes it. This freshness tradeoff is intentional.
A renderer failure logs the problem and keeps current core instructions and
routing, without retaining a previous turn's stale memory.

## Offline startup

The container supplies generated configuration and disables `.opencode` project
configuration with `OPENCODE_DISABLE_PROJECT_CONFIG`. It declares no plugin and
uses normal writable native config locations; there is no managed config tree,
managed `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` override, or config symlink. The host still supplies
per-session `XDG_DATA_HOME` for persisted native state and the rendered memory
file. Host-native configuration remains separate.

Pinned OpenCode may attempt its own background authoring-dependency install in
a writable config directory. With no declared plugin, server startup does not
wait for it. Offline native tests establish that model turns, compaction and
Task children work without a package-registry response. Existing containers must
be recreated after refresh to discard config symlinks from the earlier payload.

## MCP timing

MCP calls allow 330 seconds, covering the core's five-minute human question
window plus transport overhead. Cancelling a turn cancels its active tool wait;
a question already posted to chat remains visible.

## Credentials and installation

Authentication uses this NanoClaw installation's OneCLI management URL, API key,
and optional project ID. Secret metadata is checked before prompting for a key.
Rotation updates the same secret ID to preserve grants. Moving an API key to a
different exact host requires explicit confirmation; the existing value may be
kept or replaced. The original metadata is rechecked before writing. Ambiguous names, wildcard hosts, inherited
secrets, and incompatible credential types stop the flow. Supported API-key providers declare their
actual header scheme, including Google's `x-goog-api-key`. Unknown schemes require
an explicit adapter rather than guessing a bearer header. Local keyless endpoints
need no vault access. Provider defaults are saved only after authentication succeeds.
Exported setting conflicts are checked before credential prompts or keyed model
discovery. If a custom endpoint's model is exported, setup offers current/manual
model selection before credential work. Metadata failures identify mismatched
field names without exposing their values.

Fresh setup applies the skill, verifies contracts, builds the local image, and
then authenticates through a lazily loaded setup adapter. Normal re-authentication
of an installed provider leaves its files and image alone. Explicit `--refresh`
replaces skill-owned payloads and pins before verification/build/auth; local
payload edits must be backed up first.
An exact seam-version predicate guards all skill mutations during installation
and refresh. The install flow skips build, test, and external skill effects because
its caller owns those steps. Missing or mismatched host Bun uses the container's
pinned version through pnpm. Removal derives copied-file destinations from the
skill declarations and reverses every registration and dependency change.

The lightweight authentication check uses the skill planner to detect missing
copy, append, dependency, or CLI declarations. Since install mode deliberately
preserves existing files and packages, it separately compares exact dependency
pins and CLI fields against the same parsed skill declarations. It does not
maintain another payload inventory or run subprocesses. Existing install/refresh
contract verification imports and tests the real barrels; the build step owns
image freshness. Model selection does not repeat installation checks. Declaration
completeness is not proof that edited source, an image, or an account works.

## Verification boundaries

Unit and socket tests cover event lifetime, failure reconciliation, cancellation,
memory inheritance, vault metadata, credential rotation, setup failure ordering,
unsupported-core refusal, installation refresh, and declaration checks. The optional native test in
`payload/container/agent-runner/src/providers/opencode.native.test.ts` exercises the
actual pinned executable and SDK against a local model and MCP server, including
a 65-second tool call. These fixtures prove adapter behavior without establishing
live account entitlement, OAuth refresh reliability, or external model quality.
