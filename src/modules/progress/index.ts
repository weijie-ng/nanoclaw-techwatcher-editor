/**
 * Live progress message — default module.
 *
 * A typing indicator says "something is happening" but nothing about
 * what. On a long turn (research, a build, a chain of tool calls) the
 * user is left staring at "typing…" for minutes. This module posts a
 * single throwaway message into the chat and edits it in place while
 * the agent works: a one-line thinking summary, the last few tool
 * names, and elapsed time. When the real reply lands, the message is
 * deleted — the transcript keeps only the answer.
 *
 * Shape mirrors src/modules/typing/index.ts: a per-session Map, one
 * unref'd timer chain per entry, adapter reached through the delivery
 * module, and every failure swallowed. Progress is decoration; it must
 * never be able to break routing or delivery.
 *
 * Telegram only. It is the one channel here whose adapter implements
 * both editMessage and deleteMessage, and the edit-in-place illusion
 * falls apart without the delete (a channel that can't delete would
 * leave a stale "⏱ 34s" fossil above every answer).
 *
 * Default module status:
 *   - Lives in src/modules/ for signaling (not really core), but ships
 *     on main and is imported directly by core. No registry, no hook.
 *   - Removing requires editing src/router.ts and src/delivery.ts to
 *     drop the calls.
