/**
 * `spawn_topic_agent` delivery-action bodies.
 *
 * SECURITY: `spawn_topic_agent` writes to the CENTRAL DB (agent_groups,
 * messaging_groups, messaging_group_agents, agent_group_members,
 * agent_destinations), scaffolds host filesystem state, and creates a
 * conversation on the platform — a privileged operation a confined container
 * is otherwise architecturally barred from. The MCP tool that emits the
 * request is visible to every agent container and lives inside the untrusted
 * container, so it is not a gate: authorization MUST be enforced host-side.
 * The delivery registry wraps this action with the guard, whose
 * `topics.spawn` decision (./guard.ts) allows trusted global-scope groups and
 * holds everything else — including unknown config, fail-closed — for admin
 * approval. On approve the continuation re-enters the wrapped action with the
 * approval row as its grant and `spawnTopicAgent` runs.
 * `performSpawnTopicAgent` is the module-private body.
 *
 * Nothing here is Telegram-specific. The one platform capability required is
 * `adapter.createThread(parentPlatformId, name) -> platform_id of the new
 * sub-conversation`; every step below works for any adapter that implements
 * it. Adapters that don't are refused with a message naming the channel.

  //    only one agent so it may answer everything. That holds for AGENTS and
  //    not for HUMANS: a topic is still a shared forum conversation, so an
  //    always-on wiring makes the agent answer people talking to each other.
  //    On a mention channel the declaration resolves to 'mention', which the
  //    bridge already satisfies for a REPLY to the bot as well as an @mention
  //    (resolveInboundMention in src/channels/chat-sdk-bridge.ts promotes
  //    reply-to-bot to isMention) — so "@it or reply to it" engages and
  //    ambient chatter does not. Channels that declare an always-on group
  //    context still get always-on here; the decision moved to the
  //    declaration rather than being overridden per spawn.
  //
  //    COUPLED to step 10: the replayed brief must carry isMention so the new
  //    agent still wakes on it under a mention-mode wiring.
  //
  //    Falls back to 'mention' if the declaration is malformed (a 'pattern'
  //    context with no pattern makes resolveWiringDefaults throw). By this
  //    point the topic and the agent group exist and every remaining write is
  //    unconditional, so throwing here would strand them with no wiring at
  //    all; the conservative mode keeps the spawn coherent and recoverable
  //    with one `ncl wirings update`.
  //
  //    sender_scope is INHERITED from the wiring that asked for the spawn, not
  //    fixed at 'all': the two gates are independent, and sender_scope is the
  //    stricter one. On a 'public' messaging group the access gate returns
  //    allow before it ever asks who the sender is
  //    (src/modules/permissions/index.ts), so a wiring's sender_scope='known'
  //    is the ONLY thing keeping non-members from driving the agent — which is
  //    exactly what the channel-approval connect path writes. Hardcoding 'all'
  //    would hand a stranger in an open community chat their own agent, with
  //    its own container and a destination back to the concierge. Falling back
