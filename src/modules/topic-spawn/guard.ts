/**
 * Topic-spawn guard adapter — the module's catalog entry, composed at the
 * module edge (imported by ./index.ts).
 *
 * topics.spawn is agents.create's decision, for the same reason: the body
 * writes CENTRAL-DB state (agent_groups, container_configs,
 * messaging_groups, messaging_group_agents, agent_group_members,
 * agent_destinations), scaffolds host filesystem state, AND creates a real
 * conversation on the platform — privileged work a confined container is
 * architecturally barred from. The MCP tool that emits the request lives
 * inside the (untrusted) container and is visible to EVERY agent group —
 * there is no per-group tool selection — so the container-side surface
 * carries no authorization at all: it is trivially bypassed by writing the
 * outbound system row directly. Authorization is host-side only, here.
 *
 * `global` cli_scope is the trusted owner agent group (spawning a topic per
 * task is the intended primitive for a concierge, and an approval tap on
 * every spawn would be needless friction) → allow. Anything else — the
 * default `group` scope, the realistic prompt-injection victim, and any
 * unknown/missing config, fail-closed — holds for the requesting group's
 * admin chain. On approve the continuation re-enters the wrapped delivery
 * action with the approval row as its grant and the checks re-run live.
